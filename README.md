## Project Overview
FitFusion AI aims to be a personalized fitness and nutrition coach that provides users with tailored workout and meal plans. The system leverages multi-agent workflows to deliver a comprehensive and adaptive user experience.

## Project Scope and Objectives
- **Objectives**: Provide personalized workout and meal plans, track user progress, and offer real-time support.
- **Scope**: Features include user profile management, plan generation, data retrieval, and user interaction.

## System Architecture
FitFusion AI utilizes a multi-agent system with the following components:
- **User Interface Agent**: Manages user profiles, inputs, and displays personalized plans.
- **Data Retrieval Agent**: Fetches data from fitness and nutrition databases.
- **Plan Generation Agent**: Synthesizes data to generate personalized plans.
- **Feedback Agent**: Collects and processes user feedback to adapt plans.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Frontend**: React.js for building the user interface.
- **Backend**: FastAPI for handling backend services.
- **Data Retrieval**: Nutritionix API, OpenAI for GPT-4 integration, and Elasticsearch for indexing data.
- **Plan Generation**: LangChain and LangGraph for integrating retrieval and generation models.
- **Deployment**: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes for scalable deployment.

## Development Environment Setup
1. **Version Control**: Set up a Git repository to manage your project code.
2. **Development Tools**: Install necessary development tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and your chosen programming languages and frameworks.

## User Interface Development
1. **User Profile Management**: Create forms for user registration, profile creation, and health assessment.
2. **Dashboard**: Design a dashboard to display personalized plans, track progress, and provide feedback options.

## Multi-Agent System Implementation
### User Interface Agent
- Handles user input and displays personalized plans.
- Interacts with other agents to fetch and update data.

### Data Retrieval Agent
- Fetches fitness and nutrition data from external APIs.
- Indexes data in Elasticsearch for efficient retrieval.

### Plan Generation Agent
- Uses LangChain and LangGraph to generate personalized plans.
- Considers user profiles, goals, and preferences.

### Feedback Agent
- Collects user feedback on plans.
- Uses feedback to adjust future plans dynamically.

## Data Source Integration
1. **APIs**: Integrate with APIs like Nutritionix for nutritional data and fitness databases for workout routines.
2. **Elasticsearch**: Set up Elasticsearch to index and retrieve data efficiently.

## Plan Generation Algorithms
### Workout Plan Generation
- Develop algorithms to generate workout plans based on user profiles, goals, and retrieved data.

### Meal Plan Generation
- Develop algorithms to generate meal plans considering dietary preferences, caloric needs, and nutritional requirements.

## Application Deployment
1. **Containerization**: Use Docker to containerize the application for consistent development, testing, and deployment environments.
2. **Orchestration**: Deploy the application on Kubernetes for automatic scaling, load balancing, and managing microservices.

## Testing and Iteration
1. **User Testing**: Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the applicationâ€™s usability and effectiveness.
2. **Iteration**: Continuously improve the application based on user feedback and testing results.

## How to Run the Project
### Prerequisites
- **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Node.js**: Required for running the React frontend.

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fitfusion-ai.git
   cd fitfusion-ai/backend
